        <h2>What is Python?</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
            It is widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, 
            scientific computing, and more.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Python in Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            In our project, we utilize Python for multiple purposes. We use Python's Flask framework to build and 
            host our website, enabling smooth interaction between users and our services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, Python helps us develop prediction models using advanced libraries and tools. For example, 
            we integrate the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to perform real-time object detection and predictions 
            efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python's extensive ecosystem and ease of use allow our team to rapidly prototype, test, and deploy solutions 
            that meet our project goals effectively.
