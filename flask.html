        <h2>What is Flask?</h2>
        <p>
            Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework written in Python. It is designed to make web development
            simple and easy, allowing developers to build web applications quickly with minimal setup.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Flask in Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            In our project, we use Flask to create and host the entire website. Flask provides us with the tools to
            build
            web pages, handle user requests, and manage backend logic efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flask's simplicity allows our team to focus on developing core features without unnecessary complexity,
            while its extensibility supports integration with other technologies and databases as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            By leveraging Flask, we ensure our website is reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain throughout the
            project lifecycle.
