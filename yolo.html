        <h2>What is YOLO?</h2>
        <p>
            YOLO, which stands for "You Only Look Once," is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.
            It is known for its speed and accuracy in detecting multiple objects within images or video frames
            simultaneously.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use YOLO in Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            In our project, we utilize YOLO to build prediction models that can quickly and accurately identify objects
            in real-time. This capability is essential for applications such as surveillance, autonomous systems, and
            other intelligent detection tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            By integrating YOLO, our team can perform efficient object detection that supports the core functionalities
            of our project, ensuring high performance and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
            YOLO's powerful architecture allows us to process data rapidly, enabling real-time predictions and enhancing
            the overall user experience.
